# UtterPlan development rules

1. UtterPlan is engine-independent.
2. `.utterplan.json` schema v1 is the canonical inter-package contract.
3. Python objects may not contain semantic state that cannot survive file roundtrip.
4. UtterPlan ends before G2P.
5. Core code must not import PyKokoro, PiperSynth, kokorog2p, piperg2p, ONNX Runtime, or audio packages.
6. Public UtterancePlan objects contain no phonemes, model token IDs, models, sessions, or audio.
7. Completed plans must not retain spaCy or provider documents.
8. Every offset has a documented coordinate space.
9. Default planning is deterministic.
10. Schema changes require explicit compatibility review.
11. Repository tests must be self-contained and must not require sibling consumer checkouts.
12. Consumer-specific compatibility testing belongs in the consumer repository.
13. Released schema files are immutable and retained under versioned paths.
14. Every supported older schema must retain a sequential migration path to current.
15. Migrations operate on serialized plain data and may not call parser, planner, G2P, renderer, or audio stages.
16. Schema changes require frozen historical fixture coverage, deterministic migration tests, and package artifact checks.
17. Package version and schema version remain independent. Migration preserves a compiled plan; replanning is a separate operation.
